fieldtest
=========

This is a collection of some telehash field-test utilities.

Via command line, you can use "node tft.js" for a simple shell.

To try it out in any browser, put fieldtest.* on any web server and load it, or even from your local filesystem via file:///path-to-thjs/fieldtest.html.

An chrome app version making use of the native UDP networking is in the [chrome](chrome) folder (in progress!).
